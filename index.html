    <h1>Love Coffee? Love Dogs? Can't Sleep?</h1>
    <h2>Welcome home.</h2>
    <p>This is an <b>exclusive</b> community <em>exclusively</em> for people that love coffee and can never get enough,
      while at the same time they complain every morning that they couldn't get to sleep last night, and oh yeah, they also love dogs.
      There's no judgement here. We never get tired about talking about coffee, dogs, and late night TV.
